# Machine Learning Project

Project 1: Logistic Regression - Titanic Survival Classification
This project involves building a logistic regression model to classify whether a passenger survived or was deceased using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to apply machine learning techniques to predict survival outcomes based on various features of the passengers.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, available on Kaggle: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

Project Overview
In this project, we perform the following steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Feature scaling and transformation
Model Building:

Constructing and training a logistic regression model
Evaluating model performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy
Model Evaluation:

Generating classification reports to assess model performance
Analyzing precision, recall, F1-score, and support for different classes
Key Metrics
The evaluation of the logistic regression model includes:

Precision: Measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
Recall: Measures the ability to identify all relevant instances.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions.
